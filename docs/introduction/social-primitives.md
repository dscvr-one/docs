# Social Primitives

DSCVR is built around three basic primitives that drive the user experience: Profiles, Portals, and Content. On an abstract level, you can look at Profiles and Portals simply as “folders” that Content can exist within.

## Profiles

Profiles are the cornerstone of individual identity within the Web3 ecosystem. These profiles offer a blend of traditional social media functionality with blockchain-enabled features, including paired wallets and the ability to transfer tokens. Profiles are designed to be both a personal showcase and a gateway for other users to engage with them. User profiles develop unique social and interest graphs through their communities, connections, and engagement.

## Portals

Portals serve as dedicated gateways to specific communities, projects, or topics. Like a Web3 subreddit or discord server, each portal is a hub where users can discover curated content, join discussions, and connect with others who share similar interests. Portals leverage blockchain technology to offer unique features such as token-gated access, NFT marketplaces, and community governance models, creating a versatile environment for community engagement and content discovery.

## Content

At the heart of DSCVR is content, which spans a wide range of formats – from written posts and image galleries to videos and interactive dApps. Content exists within both posts and comments and is surfaced in profiles, portals, and feeds. A piece of content can be engaged with by viewing, reacting to, tipping, reporting, or sharing it, or by interacting with a Frame within it. DSCVR’s content architecture is designed to be flexible and interact seamlessly with on-chain data so that it can open up new distribution and monetization pathways for content creators.
