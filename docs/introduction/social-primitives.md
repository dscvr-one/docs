# Social Primitives

DSCVR is built around three basic primitives that drive the user experience.

## User Profiles

User profiles are the cornerstone of individual identity within the Web3 ecosystem. These profiles offer a blend of traditional social media functionalities with blockchain-enabled features, including wallet integration for showcasing NFT ownership, token-based interactions, and more. User profiles are designed to be both a personal showcase and a gateway for other users to engage with them, access unique content, and participate in token-gated portals.

## Portals

Portals serve as dedicated gateways to specific communities, projects, or topics. Like a Web3 subreddit, each portal is a hub where users can discover curated content, join discussions, and connect with others who share similar interests. Portals leverage blockchain technology to offer unique features such as token-gated access, community governance models, and the ability to host decentralized applications (dApps), creating a versatile environment for community engagement and content discovery.

## Content

At the heart of DSCVR is content, which spans a wide range of formats – from written posts and articles to videos and interactive experiences. Content encapsulates DSCVR’s capability to support creators through Web3 functionalities, including content discovery, tipping and monetization, and creator-defined airdrops. It is designed to foster a rich ecosystem of information sharing, creativity, and collaboration, with an emphasis on empowering creators and providing value to the community.
