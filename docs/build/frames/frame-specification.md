# Frame Specification

DSCVR supports the [Open Frame Specification](https://github.com/open-frames/standard/blob/v0.0.1/README.md) for interoperability with other platforms. DSCVR also supports additional tags and fields that are specific to the DSCVR platform. This document describes the comprehensive set of tags and fields that are supported by DSCVR.

There are three parts to this specification: 

- The set of HTML tags that DSCVR supports.
- The JSON payload that DSCVR sends to the frame server.
- HTTP codes, and other expectations of the frame server.
