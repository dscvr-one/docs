# DSCVR Canvas (Early Preview)

DSCVR Canvas is a framework for building embedded applications in DSCVR. Canvas applications are just regular web applications that run in a secure environment on DSCVR's platform.

Launching a Canvas Application is very straightforward. Just create a post with your Application's URL. The Application will be automatically registered, and distributed to DSCVR's users. If you like, you can embed your application in either a single post or in multiple posts across different portals/communities.

::: warning
DSCVR Canvas is currently in early preview. The UX, protocol, and tooling may change as the framework evolves.
