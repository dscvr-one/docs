# DSCVR Canvas Embedded Apps

DSCVR Canvas is a framework for building web applications, referred to as Canvases, that are embedded and distributed on DSCVR's platform. 

Canvases can be built using familiar Web UI and server frameworks (Vue, React, Next.js, etc), and deployed on the infrastructure of your choice (Vercel, Heroku, Cloudflare, etc). 

Once built, a Canvas can be easily distributed on DSCVR by embedding it in a post.
