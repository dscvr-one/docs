## DSCVR API Launch

DSCVR is excited to announce the launch of their new DSCVR API, offering a novel approach to social media by integrating new ways to enhance the social experience for Web3 users worldwide. This includes connecting to Solana wallets, discovering lootboxes, receiving airdrops, viewing and transacting assets, displaying verified profile pictures (PFPs), and creating token-gated communities.

One of the most talked about opportunities in Web3 is the concept of Frames: a new way to create your own integrated experiences within a post on DSCVR. The launch of the API includes the opportunity to develop Frames on DSCVR.
