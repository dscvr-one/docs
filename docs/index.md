# What is DSCVR?

With over half a million monthly unique visitors, DSCVR (pronounced “Discover”) is the largest Web3 social network and community building platform. DSCVR combines the usability of a Web2-style social app with crypto technology that unlocks ownership, monetization and distribution for users, creators, and projects. Through its native token functionality, DSCVR rewards users and supercharges community-building, while its API allows developers to build applications that target through the social graph, distribute through the feed, and monetize in posts. In the face of increasing frustration with Web2 social, DSCVR is bringing back openness, fairness, and optimism.

## DSCVR API

Introducing the DSCVR API: create your own social embedded applications. The DSCVR API offers developers the opportunity to create crypto-enabled applications with deep integrations throughout a leading Web3 social network.

Phase I of the DSCVR API allows developers to create embeddable apps within posts called DSCVR Frames. Through Frames, developers and projects can target DSCVR’s social graph and get viral distribution for their apps in the DSCVR feed. Users will discover Frames that are trending among their connections and communities.

Frames are one of the most talked about new concepts in Web3 and DSCVR has developed upon and plans to continue to contribute to the [Open Frames](https://github.com/open-frames/standard/blob/v0.0.1/README.md) standard. However, Frames are just the tip of the iceberg; our API will continue to expand to allow for more robust embeddable applications and deeper integrations throughout DSCVR.
